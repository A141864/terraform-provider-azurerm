# Example: Parameters and Outputs

~> **Note:** This example uses [Storage Accounts](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/storage_account.html) and [Public IP's](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/public_ip.html) which are natively supported by Terraform - we'd highly recommend using the Native Resources where possible instead rather than an ARM Template, for the reasons outlined above.
